<p>The editor UI color can be easily adjusted by the developer to match the look and feel of a website or an application where CKEditor 4 is embedded in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that this feature can only be used for editor skins that are compatible with the so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/skin_sdk_chameleon.html">&ldquo;chameleon&rdquo; feature</a>. The skins created by CKSource, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/moono-lisa">Moono-Lisa</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/moono">Moono</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/kama">Kama</a>, already support it. If you are using a custom skin, you will need to define the&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_skin.html#method-chameleon">CKEDITOR.skin.chameleon</a>&nbsp;function in your&nbsp;<code>skin.js</code>&nbsp;file.</p>

<p>If you want to change the default UI color, you need to define the&nbsp;<a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uiColor">CKEDITOR.config.uiColor</a>&nbsp;configuration setting which accepts an RGB color code.</p>
